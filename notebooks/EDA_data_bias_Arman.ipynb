    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be performing EDA on the jigsaw unintended bias dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of 2 million comments from Civil Comments, which has since been taken down: **['read more about Civil Comments here'](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Background on the dataset can be found here: **['kaggle toxicity classification data'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notible takeaeays from the competitions dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For evaluation, test set examples with target >= 0.5 will be considered to be in the positive class (toxic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labelling Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the toxicity labels, each comment was shown to up to 10 annotators. Annotators were asked to: 'Rate the toxicity of this comment'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very Toxic (a very hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful comment that is very likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)\n",
    "- Toxic (a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is somewhat likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)\n",
    "- Hard to Say\n",
    "- Not Toxic\n",
    "\n",
    "These ratings were then aggregated with the target value representing the fraction of annotations that annotations fell within the former two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotators\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxicity and identity labeling was done in 2018 on the Figure Eight crowd rating platform, which has since been purchased by Appen. Annotators came from all over the world, and all were proficient in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raters were compensated 1.5 cents per judgment, a rate that was set based on two factors: what rates were competitive on the platform and targeting an hourly wage appropriate for raters' locales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure Eight offers raters the option to select from multiple tasks with different pay, so rates need to be competitive to attract enough raters. At a rate of 1.5 cents per judgment, enough raters participated to complete this annotation in a few weeks. Following task completion, raters were given a satisfaction survey where the average score for \"Pay\" was 3.8 out of 5, which aligned with Figure Eight's recommendation to target pay to a satisfaction score greater than 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hourly rates for workers depend on how fast judgements were completed. Most raters will have earned between 0.90/hour (at one comment per minute) to 5.40/hour (at 6 comments per minute), which aligns with typical hourly pay in the geographic regions where most raters are located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset was annotated in 2018, more tools have become available to help set rates. Consequently, typical pay for data annotation is increasing globally.globally. Toxic"
